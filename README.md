# Web Scraper for GRE Words
This script was written to scrape a website for GRE words along with the definitions and store them in an orderly manner in a text file<br>
But with a few changes, it can be used to scrape any website for data contained in tables and store them in a text file.

## How to use
1) Clone the repository and run the python script yourself to overwrite the text file
2) Make some changes to scrape other websites for other information if needed
3) Use the .txt file directly in case you want to prepare for GRE or improve your vocabulary in general
